# file-compressor

File Compressor project developed for the Algorithms and Data Structures II subject at Federal University of ABC, given by professor [Carlo Kleber da Silva Rodrigues](https://sites.google.com/site/carlokleber/home) in the third quarter of 2019. The proposed topic was file compression and transmission in Telemedicine Networks which uses Huffman Algorithm or Run-Length Encoding method.
